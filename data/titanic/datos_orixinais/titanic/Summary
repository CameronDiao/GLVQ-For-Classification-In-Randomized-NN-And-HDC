The titanic dataset gives the values of four categorical attributes
for each of the 2201 people on board the Titanic when it struck an
iceberg and sank.  The attributes are social class (first class,
second class, third class, or crewmember), age (adult or child), sex,
and whether or not the person survived.  The question of interest is
considered to be how survival relates to the other attributes.
